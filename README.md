# Automated CAPTCHA Solver

## Overview
This project provides an automated solution for solving CAPTCHAs from image URLs. It is designed to process image URLs, extract CAPTCHA text, and return the solved string. The application defaults to using an attached sample image if no URL is provided.

## Features
*   **URL-based CAPTCHA solving:** Accepts a URL pointing to a CAPTCHA image for processing.
*   **Default sample image handling:** Utilizes a pre-attached sample image when no URL is specified.
*   **Text extraction:** Implements logic to recognize and extract characters from CAPTCHA images.
*   **API endpoint:** Provides a simple interface for submitting CAPTCHA images.

## Usage
To use the CAPTCHA solver:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/captcha-solver-123.git
    cd captcha-solver-123
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # (Specify your dependency installation command here, e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt)
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    # (Specify your application run command here, e.g., python app.py)
    ```
4.  **Submit a CAPTCHA:**
    *   **Via URL:** Send a GET request to the application endpoint with the `url` query parameter.
        ```
        http://localhost:5000/?url=https://example.com/path/to/your/captcha.png
        ```
    *   **Using the default sample:** Access the application endpoint without any parameters.
        ```
        http://localhost:5000/
        ```

## Technical Details
This application is built using [mention your primary language, e.g., Python] with the help of [mention key libraries/frameworks, e.g., Flask for the web framework and OpenCV/Pillow for image processing]. The core logic involves [briefly describe the image processing steps, e.g., image preprocessing (grayscale, thresholding, noise reduction) and character recognition using OCR techniques or a trained model].
