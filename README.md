# Captcha Solver 123

## Overview
This project provides a web application designed to automatically solve CAPTCHA images. It can process CAPTCHA images provided via a URL parameter, with a default fallback to an attached sample image for testing.

## Features
*   Accepts CAPTCHA image URLs via the `?url=` query parameter.
*   Includes a default sample CAPTCHA image for immediate testing.
*   Automates the process of identifying and decoding CAPTCHA characters.

## Usage
1.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    # Assuming you have the application running locally on port 5000
    python app.py
    ```
2.  **Solve a CAPTCHA from a URL:**
    Open your browser and navigate to:
    `http://localhost:5000/?url=https://example.com/path/to/your/captcha.png`
    Replace `https://example.com/path/to/your/captcha.png` with the actual URL of the CAPTCHA image.
3.  **Use the default sample CAPTCHA:**
    Simply navigate to:
    `http://localhost:5000/`
    The application will use the pre-attached sample image.

## Technical Details
The application utilizes [mention key libraries/frameworks used, e.g., Flask for web framework, OpenCV for image processing, Tesseract OCR for text recognition, etc.]. It involves image preprocessing steps such as grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and binarization to enhance character recognition accuracy before feeding the image to an OCR engine.
