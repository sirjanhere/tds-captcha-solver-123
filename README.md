# Captcha Solver

## Overview
This project provides a web application that automatically solves CAPTCHAs. It can process CAPTCHAs from a given URL or use a default attached sample image.

## Features
*   Accepts CAPTCHA image URLs via a `url` query parameter.
*   Includes a default CAPTCHA image for demonstration.
*   Leverages advanced image processing and machine learning techniques for accurate solving.

## Usage
To use the CAPTCHA solver:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd captcha-solver-123
    ```
2.  **Run the application:**
    (Details on how to run the application, e.g., `npm start`, `python app.py`, etc. would go here.)
3.  **Solve a CAPTCHA:**
    *   **Using a URL:** Access the application in your browser and append the `url` query parameter with the direct link to your CAPTCHA image. For example: `http://localhost:PORT/?url=https://example.com/path/to/your/captcha.png`
    *   **Using the default sample:** Simply access the application without any query parameters to use the pre-loaded sample CAPTCHA.

## Technical Details
This application utilizes [mention key technologies, e.g., Python with Flask/Django, Node.js with Express, a specific OCR library like Tesseract, or a deep learning framework like TensorFlow/PyTorch]. The core logic involves [briefly explain the process, e.g., image preprocessing (denoising, binarization), character segmentation, and character recognition using a trained model].
